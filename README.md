The goal of npiShiny is to provide a Shiny app for enhanced search of
the U.S. National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry. The original
registry is available [here](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/). This
Shiny app leverages the [npi](https://github.com/frankfarach/npi)
package which helps access the API (v2.1) from the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services.

## Try it out

The app is deployed to shinyapps.io
[here](https://parmsam.shinyapps.io/npiShiny/)
